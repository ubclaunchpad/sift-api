[{"fb_body":"My daughter wanted this book and the price on Amazon was the best.  She has already tried one recipe a day after receiving the book.  She seems happy with it.","fb_id":0},{"fb_body":"I bought this zoku quick pop for my daughterr with her zoku quick maker. She loves it and have fun to make her own ice cream.","fb_id":1},{"fb_body":"There is no shortage of pop recipes available for free on the web, but I purchased the \"Zoku Quick Pops\" book, because Zoku has some good recipes for fruit pops on its blog. I was hoping there were more where those came from. This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however. There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops. There is a \"Fresh and Fruity\" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled \"I Scream for Quick Pops!\", \"Bake Shop\", and  \"Coco Loco\". As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on \"Tips\" and \"Techniques\" are useful. There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual. The book lists options for dairy products and sweeteners, tells you how to do different types of layers, how to add decorative fruit slices, how to do a quick shell, and how to make core pops. The pages about core pops are especially helpful, as they include recipes for pink, purple, and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops. The book recommends using Zoku accessory kits, but you can do without.The pop recipes tend to go out of their way to be as sweet as possible. Many, including the recipe for a vanilla base, call for vanilla pudding, where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well. I've substituted it with no ill effect. On the bright side, many of these recipes may appeal to children, whereas most pop books that I have seen are geared more to adults. There are flavors like \"Cookie Dough\", \"That's a S'more\", chocolate peanut butter, and peanut butter and jelly. All 9 recipes in \"Bake Shop\" are inspired by cake and cookie recipes.As a resource for light, fresh-tasting fruit pop recipes, \"Zoku Quick Pops\" is very limited. Most of the fruit recipes are gimmicky and contain too many ingredients. The recipe for Lemonade pops contains orange juice, which is fine, but the addition of vanilla extract kills the fresh fruit flavor. The recipe for mango pops includes orange, apple, banana and lemon, which are too many competing flavors. Mango and orange together make a terrific pop. The book is great for chocolate lovers and those looking for dessert pop recipes. Tips and techniques are also useful. For fruit pop recipes, \"Top Pops\" by Emily Zaiden is far better.","fb_id":2},{"fb_body":"This book is a must have if you get a Zoku (which I also highly recommend). There is a large variety of recipes from simple, to fancy. The flavor combos are creative, and it gives you ideas for decorating the pops too. They turn out as beautiful as they are tasty. After reading it you will be inspired to create your own recipes too.","fb_id":3},{"fb_body":"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others, but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far, but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one, and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also, it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended.","fb_id":4},{"fb_body":"If you have a Zoku Quick Pop maker (or two....I have the original one-slot and then I bought the double-slot here at Amazon), I recommend you get this creative little book, which will inspire you.","fb_id":5},{"fb_body":"This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow. It helps you to understand the Zoku better. It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds. These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit. It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice. I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku. Dividing 3/4 of a cup, 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen.","fb_id":6},{"fb_body":"I bought this when I bought the pop maker. I think the recipes are fine, but there really isn't much in the book I wouldn't have figured out myself.A couple of good creamy recipes that are now available for free on recipe websites. As for \"pop embellishing\" well, that wasn't too hard to figure out, either. I'd save the money and spend it instead on extra pop sticks, which seem to disappear the way socks do....","fb_id":7},{"fb_body":"The Zoku accessories are pricey, but the recipes have the exact amount you need to make the pops.  I have made it through 15 varieties so far, and I like them all.","fb_id":8},{"fb_body":"High quality book. Clear and helpful information, and then some superb recipe suggestions clearly outlined. I can highly recommend this product.","fb_id":9}]
